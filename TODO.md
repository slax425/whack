**TODO**
========
- [ ] Fix support for dynamic arrays (also `append` "intrinsic" function)
- [x] Support explicit closure variable capture/init (codegen)
- [ ] Revisit Reference semantics
- [ ] Do basic lifetime checks to avoid dangling pointers/invalid references
- [ ] Closure capture nothing ([]) or everything by value (default) [=] / by reference [&] -> (codegen)
- [ ] Fix boolean expressions (mainly a grammar issue)
- [ ] Support implicit type conversions for structs via operator overloads
- [ ] Support binary, octal & hexadecimal numbers
- [x] Support explicit partial function application
- [ ] Support partial function application for up to N - 1 of N args
- [ ] Constistent Name Mangling (currently ad-hoc) -> support `export` construct
- [ ] Distinguish pre/post increment/decrement operator functions (via mangled names?)
- [ ] Interfaces, inheritance
- [ ] Refactor/Redo types/type lists
- [ ] Comments
- [ ] Lift the `type(<expression>)` construct to be a type
- [ ] Refactor `fntype` grammar to accepts `args` (to support naming arg types)
- [ ] Template to generate syntax file for sublime text from grammar
- [ ] Proper structured bindings for pattern matching
- [ ] Guarantee copy elision
- [ ] Proper sublime_text tooling
- [ ] CodeGenError class (taking string error & state?)
- [ ] Support message passing channels & constructs
- [ ] Support atomic types
- [ ] Extensive testing
- [ ] Other random refactoring/fixes/improvements...
